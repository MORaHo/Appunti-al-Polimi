# Lezione 1 - Introduction

The professor did an introduction of the course, outlining what topics we will be covering. Primarily the object of our study will be vibrations of systems with n-degrees of freedom. The principal equation which we will be using for this study is the Lagrange equation:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{ \partial E_{c} }{ \partial \dot{\underline{q}} }  \right)-\frac{ \partial E_{c} }{ \partial \underline{q} }+\frac{ \partial V }{ \partial \underline{q} } +\frac{ \partial D }{ \partial \dot{\underline{q}} } = \underline{Q} $$

Where $\underline{q}$ is the vector of the degrees of freedom and $\underline{\dot{q}}$ is the derivative of the vector of the degree of freedom.
